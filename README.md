# Developer Test
## Skills Test for Front-end Developer Candidates

Hi there! If you're here, you're probably looking to take our Developer Test as part of our interview process at Story Block. We like people who can follow instructions, take initiaitive, and fill in the gaps on their own if need be. Have fun, be creative, and good luck! Oh, and don't forget to read all of these instructions before you start.

1. Sign up for a Hubspot developer discovery kit: https://designers.hubspot.com/discoverykit (or just skip to sign up for a Developer Sandbox here: https://app.hubspot.com/signup/standalone-cms-developer/)
1. When you have your Development Sandbox setup, navigate to the Hubspot Design Tools and create the following items for your developer test:
    1. A new CSS file (your styles will go here)
    1. A new JS file (your javascript will go here)
    1. A new Drag and Drop template
1. Now the fun starts! Customize your template, CSS, and JS to match this design: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/5a66328f-2a41-4043-673b-8095dbadee8d-2c57/ (you'll notice you can download all the assets and styles you need for the make the design)
1. Publish your template when you're done.
1. Create a new web page from your template, add some content to it, and publish it.
1. Ensure that your final template:
    1. Is mobile friendly and responsive (use your best judgement on how to execute a responsive version of the design)
    1. Contains one Flexible Column Module where you will add content within the page editor
    1. Has no glaring usability issues
    1. Showcases your skillz (please feel free to jazz it up with animation or interactivity as you see fit).
    1. Takes advantage of the Hubspot CMS as much as possible -- allow as much content as you can to be editible on a page-level basis, and use built-in hubspot modules where appropriate.
1. When you're ready, email us the shareable preview link for the template and the webpage that you made. If you have any questions, email the person that sent you this test.
